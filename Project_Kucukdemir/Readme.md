# Synthesizing Mesh Deformation Sequences with Bidirectional LSTM

This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG502 (Spring 2022)](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr/~skalkan/ADL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG502 (Spring 2022) Project List]([https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG502-Spring2021](https://github.com/CENG502-Projects/CENG502-Spring2022)) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.
